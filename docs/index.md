# MerakiBlocki

Simple app to pull all of your meraki clients and compare them against a list of 'allowed' clients. Your approved clients come from google sheets as well: paste the link to your sheet, add a little info, and it will automatically index it!

## Install

The full add-on is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merakiblocki/gfahbfffpkbhomhgmnnlbbonfkgdjmdf). Just add it onto google sheets.

When you install the app, it should ask if you want to initialize your spreadsheet. If it doesn't, just go to Add-ons -> MerakiBlocki -> Advanced -> Initialize spreadsheet

Eventually, you'll be able to go [here](https://mismatch.io/index.php/merakiapp) to get more information, but it's not ready yet.
