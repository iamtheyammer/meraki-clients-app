# meraki-clients-app
Simple app to pull all of your meraki clients and compare them against a list of 'allowed' list.

Make sure to use the spreadsheet available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1STQQAHvW9Re4vmFnHRnu6PVjX5TfdUFUVaH8jDba5LE/edit#gid=0), otherwise the app may not work the way you want it to.

The full add-on is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merakiapp/gfahbfffpkbhomhgmnnlbbonfkgdjmdf). Just add it onto google sheets.

Eventually, you'll be able to go [here](https://mismatch.io/index.php/merakiapp) to get more information, but it's not ready yet.

This app is dedicated to our school's IT guy, Paul and our networking guru Chris.
