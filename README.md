# meraki-clients-app
Simple app to pull all of your meraki clients and compare them against a list of 'allowed' list.

## Story

This project taught me to code. See [here](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/meraki-clients-app/commit/e6577e39edbae1cce307cdabac27c87e255246a4) for a little more info. It's been a fun ride.

## Install

The full add-on is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merakiblocki/gfahbfffpkbhomhgmnnlbbonfkgdjmdf). Just add it onto google sheets. Or, you can make a new spreadsheet of your choice, go to Add-ons, Get add-ons... and search for MerakiBlocki.

When you install the app, it should ask if you want to initialize your spreadsheet. If it doesn't, just go to Add-ons -> MerakiBlocki -> Advanced -> Initialize spreadsheet

Go to our website, [https://merakiblocki.com](https://merakiblocki.com), for more information ~or tobuy a license~.
