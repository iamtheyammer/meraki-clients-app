    <h1>MerakiBlocki</h1>

    <p>Simple app to pull all of your meraki clients and compare them against a list of 'allowed' clients. Your approved clients come from google sheets as well: paste the link to your sheet, add a little info, and it will automatically index it!</p>

    <h2>Install</h2>

    <p>The full add-on is available <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merakiblocki/gfahbfffpkbhomhgmnnlbbonfkgdjmdf">here</a>. Just add it onto google sheets.</p>

    <p>When you install the app, it should ask if you want to initialize your spreadsheet. If it doesn't, just go to Add-ons -> MerakiBlocki -> Advanced -> Initialize spreadsheet</p>

    <p>Eventually, you'll be able to go <a href="https://mismatch.io/index.php/merakiapp">here</a> to get more information, but it's not ready yet.</p>
